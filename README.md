######Note
- Must be logged in to access the Driver Database
- No field is required when creating new drivers for flexibility
- Status color schemes set to mirror JIRA ticket status colors
- Forgot Password is not functional

##Future Features (From highest to lowest priority)
1. Count: Number of drivers for each status, especially total (demo/deployed) listed on homepage
  - Progress has been made but incomplete
  - Commented out pertaining code found in `drivers.server.routes.js` and `drivers.server.controller.js`
2. File Upload: E.g. user manual upload capability in the individual driver modals
3. updatedAt field and by who?

##To run...

######In browser
This app is currently deployed via ([Heroku](https://tsdriverappprod.herokuapp.com/)).

  ###### Note
Uses Free Dyno plan from Heroku which puts the app to sleep after 30 min. of inactivity. Users can still access the app at anytime but the first launch of the app when it is asleep will take longer than usual. Subsequent launches of the app will be fast assuming the app is awake.

######Locally
1. Clone or download zip
2. cd to root of the project
3. Run by entering `$ node server` or `$ grunt` to refresh page after local code changes
4. See it in action by going to localhost:3000 in a browser
